    <string name="rules">How To Play the Flocking Game:\n
        Players begin by each selecting a bird to play the round with. \n
        Players then place their bird on the game area, one at a time. \n
        Once both birds are set using the Set Bird button, \n
        each player may choose a new bird for the next round. \n
        Players will alternate placing order for each new round. \n
        If a placed bird overlaps another \n
        or goes outside the playing box, \n
        that player to have placed it loses! \n
